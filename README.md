# Agriculture Crop Yield Prediction

This project was created during the MCMC Datathon and aims to predict how much crops will yield using machine learning. It uses a large dataset that includes information about different regions, types of soil, types of crops, the amount of rainfall, and temperature. The project also connects to the OpenWeatherMap API to get real-time weather data, which helps make the predictions more accurate. It includes tools for analyzing the data, creating visualizations, and training models to understand the factors that affect crop yield.
